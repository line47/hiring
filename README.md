# Using GitHub repo for design hiring

## What we currently use and get from Google sheets
- Name of candidate
- Link to portfolio 
- Notes
- Who is reviewing
- Who is tiebreaking

## What we could get in addition by using Github
- Folks won’t have to manually check the Google sheet 
- Assign reviewers and tie breakers
- Can get notifications when issue is assigned to you
- Get notifications in the design-hiring Slack when new items are added
- Place to have conversation about logistics of candidate (add more details, etc…)
- Ability to add labels like `tie breaker needed` or any other additional helpful labels
- Can see at a glance what has been completed when looking at issue list (1 of 3) in screenshot below
